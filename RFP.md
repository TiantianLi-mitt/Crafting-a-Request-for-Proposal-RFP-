#### **1.0 Introduction**

The Holiday Inn Winnipeg-Airport West is a renowned hotel dedicated to providing an excellent accommodation experience for both business and leisure travellers. Located at 1740 Ellice Ave, our facility includes 350 modern guest rooms, multiple function halls, a large ballroom, a full-service restaurant, a lounge, and a fitness centre.

To continually enhance guest satisfaction and support the digital transformation of our hotel operations, we are seeking proposals from top-tier IT solution providers for a comprehensive upgrade of our wireless network infrastructure. Our objective is to deploy a seamless, full-coverage, highly secure, and easily manageable next-generation wireless network that delivers a superior internet experience for our guests while ensuring the stability of our operational network.

#### **2.0 Project Scope**

**2.1 Project Objectives:**
*   **Enhance Guest Experience:** To provide high-speed, stable, and seamless roaming Wi-Fi, free of charge, in all areas of the hotel.
*   **Ensure Operational Efficiency:** To establish an independent and secure wireless network for internal hotel operations, including mobile POS systems, staff communication devices, and IoT equipment.
*   **Strengthen Data Security:** To implement robust security policies to protect guest data and ensure our payment systems are compliant with PCI-DSS standards.
*   **Simplify IT Operations:** To establish a centralized management platform that simplifies daily monitoring and maintenance tasks for our IT team.

**2.2 Coverage Area Requirements:**
The new wireless network must provide 100% coverage in the following areas:
*   **High-Density Public Areas:** Hotel lobby, restaurant, ballroom, and all meeting rooms.
*   **Guest Room Areas:** All 350 guest rooms and corresponding floor corridors.
*   **Amenity and Office Areas:** Executive lounge, fitness centre, poolside, and back-office administrative areas.

**2.3 Project Deliverables:**
1.  **Site Survey Report:** A comprehensive report including predictive signal coverage heatmaps.
2.  **Solution Design Document:** This must include the final network topology, AP placement map, equipment list, a detailed integration plan with our existing wired network, IP/VLAN plan, and security policy configurations.
3.  **Implementation and Acceptance Report:** A report containing performance test results and a security audit sign-off.
4.  **Customized Captive Portal:** A guest authentication portal that aligns with the Holiday Inn brand identity and supports multiple login methods.
5.  **Complete Operational Documentation:** Including an administrator's manual and a troubleshooting guide.
6.  **On-site Technical Training:** In-depth technical training for the hotel's IT team.

#### **3.0 Technical and Compliance Requirements**

**3.1 Integration with Existing Wired Network:**
**[KEY REQUIREMENT]**
This is a critical component of the project. The vendor must provide a detailed explanation of how the new wireless network will be seamlessly integrated into our existing wired infrastructure. The proposal must include:
*   **Assessment of Existing Infrastructure:** An evaluation of our current core switches, access switches, and firewall to determine if their performance and port capacity (e.g., PoE+ power budget, 10Gbps uplinks) are sufficient for the new system.
*   **Topology and Connectivity:** A clear network diagram showing how the new wireless controller (if applicable) and PoE switches will connect to the hotel's existing core network.
*   **VLAN and Routing Configuration:** A detailed plan for the VLAN and trunking configurations on our existing switches to ensure proper segregation and routing of data traffic between the Guest, Corporate, PCI, and IoT networks.
*   **Smooth Migration Plan:** A phased, low-risk migration strategy to ensure that mission-critical services on the existing wired network (e.g., Property Management System (PMS), IP telephony) are not disrupted during the upgrade.

**3.2 Network Performance and Architecture:**
*   **Wireless Standard:** The solution must support **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)**.
*   **Network Segregation:** Logical segregation using VLAN technology is mandatory to ensure the secure operation of at least four independent networks: Guest Network, Corporate Network, PCI Network, and IoT Network.
*   **Seamless Roaming:** The system must support 802.11k/v/r protocols to ensure smooth connectivity for mobile users.

**3.3 Security and Compliance:**
*   **Guest Network Security:** The solution must provide Client Isolation to prevent peer-to-peer communication between guest devices.
*   **WPA3 Encryption:** All SSIDs must support the **WPA3** security standard.
*   **Legal Compliance:** The design must adhere to Canada's **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)** and assist the hotel in meeting the network requirements of the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**.
*   **Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS):** The system must be capable of detecting and preventing wireless threats such as rogue APs.

**3.4 Network Management:**
*   **Centralized Management:** Provide a unified cloud-based or on-premise management platform.
*   **HSIA Gateway:** The solution must include a robust High-Speed Internet Access (HSIA) gateway that supports flexible bandwidth policies and user auditing.

#### **4.0 Vendor Qualifications**
*   **Hospitality Industry Experience:** Vendors must provide at least **three** case studies of wireless network projects completed within the last five years for 4-star or 5-star hotels.
*   **Professional Certifications:** The project team must include senior-level engineers with certifications from leading vendors (e.g., Cisco, Aruba/HPE, Ruckus).
*   **Client References:** Provide contact information for at least two IT managers from the referenced hotel projects.
*   **Local Support:** Vendors must have a permanent technical support team based in **Winnipeg** capable of providing 24/7 emergency response.
